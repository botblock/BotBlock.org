        | There is a global ratelimit on the #{__('site_name')} website per request source IP address of 10 requests
        |  every second.
    p
        | This API has ratelimits in place based on #[b request source IP address and, where possible, bot ID]. This API
        |  may get ratelimited from lists if it is inundated with requests, therefore our ratelimits are high as to
        |  reduce the likelihood of this occurring.
    p
        i The IP that #{__('site_name')} can see for your current connection is #[code #{ip || 'Unknown'}]
